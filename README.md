## Details
Build a system to track donations. The details about the donation center are not organized but given as the director might verbalize them:  
The donation center collects donations (of time, items, and money) from different types of donors (individuals, families, and organizations). A given donor may or may not be inactive. We need to know when they started and the date of their last donation. Each donation is assigned a financial value when it is entered. For each donation we track what type it is, the value of it, when it was given, and a possible description. We need to be able to display all donations for a given donor for a given year. We also need to be able to display all donations for a given donor and get the total a donor has given (over a year and over the lifetime). For each donor, there is a name and email. Family donors have a list of family names. The business donors need to track if the business is a non-profit or not. Sometimes donors become inactive and don't receive regular emails but their records are still kept.  

Data needs to be kept between runnings of the program but should not be allowed to be edited directly (only through the program).

## Phase 1
Identify what classes are needed, design interfaces for them, and then code classes themselves. An interface should be created to define the communications between these and all other classes. The data structure of the donations used should be transparent to all other code. The donor information needs to use inheritance.

## Phase 2
Take the code and add the GUI interface to it. The design should include a "diagram" of each window in the interface. Instead of an estimate of the time it will take to implement, it should include and maximum time that will be used to implement the GUI (including any time researching options).
